# Tutorials

Here are some tutorials on how to develop for RMF. These present a practical approach to understanding the [ROS2 Multi Robot Book](https://osrf.github.io/ros2multirobotbook/traffic-editor.html#gui-layout) by DIY. We would hopefully cover many useful aspects of RMF development, such as:

* RMF Structure
* Traffic Annotation
* Simulation Testing
* Hardware Integration
* Deployment Strategies

We assume that you have already installed ROS2 and RMF in some form on your workstation.

I would recommend we look at the tutorials in this order:
* Understand the [structure](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_gym/tree/main/docs/rmf_structure) of RMF.
* Get familiar with how to [create a new RMF world](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_gym/tree/main/docs/traffic_annotation/simple_lift).
* Create some worlds and some tests ( and submit tests that fail as issues! )
* Try to add a [physical robot](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_gym/tree/main/docs/hardware_integration/mobile_robot/magni).
