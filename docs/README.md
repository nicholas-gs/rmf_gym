# Tutorials

Here are some tutorials on how to develop for RMF. These present a practical approach to understanding the [ROS2 Multi Robot Book](https://osrf.github.io/ros2multirobotbook/traffic-editor.html#gui-layout) by DIY. We would hopefully cover many useful aspects of RMF development, such as:

* RMF Structure
* Traffic Annotation
* Simulation Testing
* Hardware Integration
* Deployment Strategies

We assume that you have already installed ROS2 and RMF in some form on your workstation.

Once more tutorials are developed, I will put a recommended sequence to view the tutorials here.
