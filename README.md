# rmf_gym

Welcome! `rmf_gym` aims to combine a few different goals for the [Robotics Middleware Framework](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_demos) ( RMF ):
* Practical Tutorials
* Testing infrastructure 
* Documentation

`rmf_gym_worlds` contains many RMF worlds that are optimized for focused simulation testing. There are also tutorials that teach you how to craft your own testing world,
which also functions as tutorials on how RMF works. 

It is easy to tweak the gym worlds to include your hardware for testing, by physically running your robot alongside simulations in a physical `10m x 20m` space.

`rmf_gym_tools` contain scripts and automation that help with testing RMF.
