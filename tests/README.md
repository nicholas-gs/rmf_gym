# tests
This section aims to contain tests to check that common multi-robot scenarios play out correctly.
In addition, by documenting how to create new test environments hands-on, these also act as tutorials for RMF.

For demonstration purposes, we will base on the [`Vagrant`](/envs/README.md) machine image for consistency. With minimal modifications, the tutorials should apply regardless of how you provision your devices.
